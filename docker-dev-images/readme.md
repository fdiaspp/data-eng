### How to use:
During Docker's build, use `--build-arg REQUIREMENTS` to pass commands to `pip install`. It can be 
or a `requirements.txt` file, as shown below, or the lib that you want to install.

e.g.:
```sh
docker build -t python:latest \
--build-arg REQUIREMENTS="-r requirements.txt" \
-f python.dockerfile .
```
